# DnD

## Description

- This repository holds the code for a DnD-type, text-based, terminal game

## Story Prompts

- Here will be a list of the story ideas and paths we have

## TODO

- Create the classes
    - At Ty: I created these folders already. Follow the format as in the characters folder.
        - I had to add a new file (the __init__.py file), make ones for the other folders that has the same thing
            - It just needs a list of all the classes (an import of them, with the name of the file having a dot first)
            - So, just do that.
    - Don't worry about the Paths folder. I will explain that later.
    - Also, I don't think we need a spells folder. We will deal with the spells a way other than classes.
    - Also also, I think we should call the "world" Tebalda, or something like that. Find a name as you think about things that you like.
